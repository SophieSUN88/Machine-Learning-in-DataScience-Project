# K - MEANS Clustering
show the progress of coding step by step

- K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
- Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.
- In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.
- The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.

## 1. About the code algorithm
### Step 1. Start from k=2 for the K-Mean cluster, code step by step
- k = 2, and generate the centroids randomly
- create function of distance
- create function of assignment to find the closest centroid for x point
    - definition of the assignment function to find the closest/min of the distance between x(one point) and centroid(one of the Centroids) 
    - return the index of the centroid by argmin()
    - Then we can find which centroid is most closest/min distance to x, that means x blong to that centroid cluster.
- plot the data in 2 groups
- create function of make-class 
- divide the data in to 2 groups to A
- create function of new_centroids to generate the mean center for each cluster as the new_centroids

### Step 2. put code together, try k=3 
- then we can draw the points in different color ,and see the progress from C0 to C1,to C2, to C3.

### step3 to measure the errors
- define the fit to find the best centroids
- define the MSE of class to measure the errors

### Step 4: get the final gathered code 
- have a look at the improvement of the progress with k-mean 

##  2. About the files
There are 2 files in thi folder:
- one is in .ipynb, we can see the results step by step, can see how the codes come with progress.
- one is .py, we can use the final codes that gathered together with an example.
